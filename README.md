# tnnl

This CLI is an easy way to handle some ecs-related commands. (e.g. exec, remote portfoward, etc)

Normally, it is necessary to specify the cluster name, task ID, and container ID. However, this CLI tool allows you to specify them interactively.

## Installation

Install the CLI tool with the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/wim-web/tnnl@latest
```

Or get binary from https://github.com/wim-web/tnnl/releases
